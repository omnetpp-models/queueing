- requirement for queueing network package
  o should be deployable into the new omnet ide as a separate project or 
    better a pre-compiled plugin

- nodes
  + source
	distribution, no of generated messages, message class, start/stop time
  + sink
       statistic, keep or destroy messages
  + fork (simple: duplicate the message on every output)
  + join (anything that comes in, will be sent out immediately)
  + delay
       delay time distribution
  + classifier
       strategy (based on class and priority (other msg properties) 
                 , no of connected destinations, 
  + router                 
                 destination state (roundrobin, random, mindelay, queue length, service time)
  + passive queue (max length, FIFO/LIFO) + statistics
  - server
       processing time distribution, queue policy (priority, round robin, random, longest queue first
       which queue is processed on the input (only passive queues can be attached to the input
       of the server) + statistics
  - active queue (a queue and a server) + statistics
  -p ifthenelse (router) ==, <, >, <>  based on message properties - 
								    chooses between two destination
  -p msgoperation: change message parameters (increment, dectrement, set)
                  like (class, priotity, other generic properties)
  - 

- messages
  - priority
  - class
  - name
  - generic attributes
  + statistics (total waiting time, hop count, total processing time)



- closed message classes (thenumber of messages are constant. and the messages 
  cennot be destroyed) - we can model resources
