QueueinglibExt & Queuinglib
===========================

The QueueinglibExt project demonstrates how to use and *extend* an already 
existing model library (Queueinglib) from a different project. QueueinglibExt 
contains C++ code that extends the behaviour of the Sink module from the 
Queueinglib project. The extended SinkExt module will display the number of
received jobs on the GUI. The external dependency is linked dynamically to the 
project executable.
